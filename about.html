            <h2>Asim Yaqoob</h2>
            <p>I'm an engineer who loves to build things. I love nature, art and physics. I'm also a lifelong gamer who has always been fascinated by the creative process behind video games. Video games to me are the ultimate intersection of engineering with the arts. It's been a dream of mine to create and release my own game and I started the journey in 2021 with AstraBlast.</p>
            
            <h2>Making AstraBlast</h2>
            <p>I started to teach myself game development as a hobby in my spare time. It quickly grew into a labour of love and it's been one of the most enjoyable things I've ever done! AstraBlast is the result. It is small mobile indie game but a lot of love, time and effort went into creating it. I have plans to expand the game with new content and continuous updates. I will also be working on an entirely new game in a different genre! I hope you enjoy playing AstraBlast, and please let me know what you think by leaving a review on the App Store or Google Play Store. Thanks!</p>
            
            <h2>Shout Outs!</h2>
            <p>Creating AstraBlast wouldn't have been possible without the help and support of my family and friends. My sister Zara helped greatly as producer - guiding and focusing my efforts along the way.</p>
            <p>The game also has an original music score by __MING__! A special shout out also goes to Eray Ozturk and Chris Entwistle for your great advice, all of which made its way into the game.</p>
