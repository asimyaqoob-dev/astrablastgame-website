        <h2>Section 1. Consent to Data Collection</h2>
        <p>By downloading the app, you agree that you are consenting to share analytics data as described in Section 2.</p>
        
        <h2>Section 2. Data Collected</h2>
        <p>The app collects in-game progression data using the Unity Analytics Service, which enables the developer; Asim Yaqoob, to understand and improve player experience. Data cannot be traced to individual identities nor is it shared with any external third parties outside of Unity.</p>
        
        <p>The types of in-game data that are collected include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Player scores and skill point statistics</li>
            <li>Game over statistics</li>
            <li>Usage of unlockable assets</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>In addition to in-game data, additional data types are also collected:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Coarse location (country that the device is located in)</li>
            <li>Device Model</li>
            <li>User and Device identifiers that are game-specific, which cannot be traced to individual identity.</li>

        <h2>Section 3. Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The developer accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of using the app. The developer may wish to update the app at any time without needing to seek external permission. The app is currently available on iOS and Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems that compatibility is extended to) may change, and you may need to update the app to maintain functionality.</li>
            
            <li>The developer makes no promise to perpetually update the app so that it remains relevant to you and/or works with the iOS and Android version that you currently have installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.</li>
            
            <li>The developer may wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless you are told otherwise, upon any termination, the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</li>
            
            <li>Purchase and download of the app does not grant you the right to use the app for any other purpose other than entertainment. You agree not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code from the app. The developer retains ownership of all software relating to the app, and except as expressly set forth herein, no other rights are granted.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Changes to these Terms and Conditions</h2>
